# AI Career Advisor – Frontend Dashboard

This project is a frontend dashboard UI created during a hackathon as part of an AI Career Advisor platform.

## Overview
The goal of this contribution was to design and implement a clean, modern dashboard interface that presents user progress, goals, and skill insights in a clear and engaging way. The focus was on layout, visual hierarchy, and rapid UI development under hackathon constraints.

## My Contribution

- Defined the structure for the hero section, sidebar navigation, and card-based components
- Used AI-assisted tools to accelerate the design-to-code process
- Refined the generated HTML and CSS to match the intended UI and improve visual consistency

## Tech Stack
